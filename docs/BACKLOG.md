## Product decisions to honour later

- **Shuffle and auto-queueing must prefer the highest-quality edition.** When a
  track exists in several formats (ADR-0007), any automatic selection — library
  shuffle, mood-steered radio, "play something" — picks the best available
  edition, never a random one. The fidelity ranking in ADR-0007 is a
  library-wide policy, not merely the side panel's default. *(Owner, 2026-08-07.)*
- **Per-album edition preference should persist** once the library DB is the
  right home for it (deferred in ADR-0007: persisting today would mean taking a
  TOML-parser dependency for a preference that belongs in a database column).
- ~~**A volume slider**~~ — **shipped, both halves (ADR-0011)**.
  `Command::SetVolume`/`SetMute`, a cubic taper defined once in
  `baz_core::volume`, software gain on the pump path with a 20 ms slew, and a
  structural unity short-circuit that keeps ADR-0009's bit-exactness reachable
  and pinned by test. The GUI control landed after it: a mute affordance and a
  fader in the bottom bar's right-hand end, driven by the same custom groove
  widget as the seek bar; unity is reachable by a 4 px snap at the top of the
  travel and shown by a detent mark that lights when the handle is on it;
  <kbd>↑</kbd>/<kbd>↓</kbd>/<kbd>M</kbd> on the keyboard; MPRIS `Volume`
  readable and writable through the same taper. The *device/hardware volume*
  half was investigated and deliberately not built — see below.
  The bit-exactness readout is now the conjunction ADR-0011 defines: the
  bottom bar says `bit-perfect` when the chain is `Direct` **and** the volume
  path is transparent, and says nothing (rather than something apologetic)
  when a volume below unity is scaling the samples — that fact is already on
  screen in the fader beside it.

## Known gaps in shipped features

- **Opus is not played, and therefore not listed.** *(Decided 2026-08-07;
  `.ogg`/Vorbis shipped in the same commit and plays.)* `.opus` is out of
  `AUDIO_EXTENSIONS` and `AudioFormat::is_decodable` returns `false` for it,
  so Opus files — including Opus arriving inside a `.ogg` — do not reach the
  shelf at all. Nothing is silently skipped; there is simply nothing listed.

  **Why not just add a decoder.** Every route costs more than the format is
  worth *today*, and the options were checked rather than assumed:

  - **Symphonia itself has none, in any released version.** 0.5's
    `symphonia-codec-opus` is a 1-byte placeholder and was never published to
    crates.io; **0.6.0 (2026-05-15) still ships no Opus feature**, its README
    codec table lists Opus as `-`, and [issue #8][opus-issue] has been open
    since 2020 with two unmerged WIP PRs. So *upgrading buys nothing for
    Opus* — and 0.6 is a large, unrelated migration in its own right:
    `SampleBuffer` is removed, `AudioBufferRef` becomes
    `GenericAudioBufferRef`, `CodecParameters` splits and loses `n_frames`,
    `delay`, `padding` and `start_ts` to `Track`, and — the one that matters
    most here — **`FormatOptions::enable_gapless` is gone**, replaced by
    negative PTS signalling. Every measured number in `baz_core::playback`
    would have to be re-derived. That is its own ADR and its own commit, not
    a side effect of adding a format.
  - **libopus bindings** (`symphonia-adapter-libopus` → `opusic-sys`, or the
    older `opus`/`audiopus_sys`) work today and are the only *proven* path —
    the adapter is what rodio wires up. The cost is a **C library and a
    `cmake` build dependency on every platform**, which neither this machine
    nor the `baz-dev` toolbox currently has, so it would mean editing
    `scripts/toolbox-setup.sh`, the devcontainer and all three CI runners.
    baz's decode path is pure Rust with **zero system dependencies** today
    (even SQLite is `bundled`); spending that property on one lossy format is
    not a trade worth making unprompted. (`audiopus_sys` additionally links
    libopus *dynamically* on glibc Linux and was last released in 2021.)
  - **Pure-Rust decoders exist but are too young.** `opus-rs` 0.1.26
    (BSD-3-Clause, first released 2026-02) and `opus-decoder` 0.1.1
    (MIT/Apache-2.0, `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, claims all 12 RFC 8251
    vectors) would cost no build dependency at all. Both are months old with
    tens of GitHub stars and no maintenance record, and this is a parser
    sitting in front of hostile input from the user's own filesystem —
    exactly where `ENGINEERING.md`'s "prefer proven crates" and the fuzzing
    policy point the other way.

  **What would change the decision**, in preference order: (1) Symphonia
  merges an Opus decoder — then it is a one-line feature flag with no new
  dependency and no build cost, and the container work is *already done*
  (Symphonia's Ogg demuxer parses `OpusHead`, honours the pre-skip and
  derives packet durations from the TOC byte, so gapless Opus would arrive
  working; `opus_bytes_probe_as_ogg_opus_and_never_as_aac` prints the
  pre-skip it already reads); (2) a pure-Rust Opus crate earns a real track
  record — a year of releases, adoption, and the RFC 8251 vectors run in
  *our* CI and fuzzed; (3) the owner decides a bundled-C + `cmake` build
  dependency is acceptable, in which case `symphonia-adapter-libopus` is the
  route. The reversal is small and the tests say so: `AUDIO_EXTENSIONS`
  regains `"opus"`, `AudioFormat::is_decodable` stops excluding it, and the
  probe test's `Ok(_)` arm — which currently fails the build with those
  instructions — goes away.

- **Seeking into a Vorbis stream loses one lapped block** — measured at 1024
  frames (23.2 ms at 44.1 kHz), because Symphonia's Vorbis decoder returns an
  empty buffer for the first packet after a reset and that audio is gone.
  Every other format seeks exactly (WAV/FLAC/ALAC) or time-accurately (MP3).
  The fix is to seek earlier than asked and re-derive the skip from packet
  timestamps, which touches the seek path five working formats share, so it
  is deliberately not bundled with adding the format. Documented per format
  in `playback/mod.rs` and pinned by
  `seek_into_vorbis_ogg_costs_one_lapped_block`.

- **Symphonia 0.6 is available and not taken.** Released 2026-05-15; a large
  breaking migration (see the Opus entry above for the specific API changes)
  that buys baz nothing it currently needs. Worth an ADR when there is a
  reason — video/subtitle support, a codec only 0.6 has, or an upstream fix
  we need — rather than for its own sake.

- **A deleted *directory*'s tracks still linger in the index.** Removal
  landed with ADR-0011 and deleting a *file* now clears its row on the next
  scan — but only under positive confirmation, and one of the four gates is
  "the file's parent directory is present". So `rm -rf ~/Music/Artist/Album`
  leaves eight rows behind, deliberately: from the filesystem's side a
  deleted folder and a mount point that is not mounted right now are the
  same `NotFound` for every path below, and wrongly wiping a present
  listener's library is not a bug worth trading a cosmetic stale row for.

  **What would settle it**, in preference order: (1) a *user-initiated
  prune* — "these 412 rows point at files I cannot find; remove them?" —
  which is the honest home for every case automation should decline, and
  needs a library-maintenance surface baz does not have yet; (2) remembered
  mount points, so "this directory is gone" can be distinguished from "this
  directory's filesystem is not attached"; (3) a per-row record of which
  root a track came from, which would also let gate 2 stop relying on the
  root currently being scanned. All three are features with their own
  design, not a tweak to the rule.

- **The index has no notion of which root a row came from.** Removal's
  multi-root protection keys on `starts_with(root_being_scanned)`, which is
  correct but coarse: rows imported from a folder baz has since stopped
  scanning are immortal. A `roots` table is the fix, and it wants to land
  with actual support for more than one music folder.
- **Multichannel (>2ch) files are rejected**, not downmixed — a typed error
  rather than silently wrong output. 5.1 downmix is unwritten.
- **Skip and seek are drain-and-restart**, not sample-accurate splices (tens of
  ms of latency, documented in the engine module docs).
- **Bit-perfect is shared-mode only.** Following the source rate and reopening
  on a change is implemented and is now the default (ADR-0009): baz converts
  nothing. What is still outstanding is the last hop — the system mixer may
  resample downstream of us, and only exclusive-mode backends (ALSA `hw:`,
  WASAPI exclusive, `CoreAudio` hog) can close that. `Event::SignalPath` will
  grow a field for it when they land.

- **Hardware volume needs exclusive mode, and waits for it** (ADR-0011, which
  measured this rather than assuming it). In *shared* mode there is no
  bit-exact per-application volume on any platform: the per-app controls
  (PipeWire sink-input, WASAPI `ISimpleAudioVolume`) are a float multiply
  inside the sound server, which buys nothing over doing it ourselves and costs
  a libpipewire/libpulse or `windows-sys` dependency; the *hardware* controls
  (the owner's iFi DAC has a real −127 dB attenuator, `amixer -c 3 numid=4`,
  and `IAudioEndpointVolume`/`kAudioDevicePropertyVolumeScalar` are the same
  shape) are card-wide, so driving one from a player's own slider would move
  every other application's volume — and baz cannot even identify the card,
  since cpal reports the device only as `"default"`. When baz owns the card,
  all three objections vanish at once. The seam is already in place and tested:
  `Sink::set_device_volume` returns `None` from every shipped backend, and a
  backend that returns `Some` gets `VolumePath::DeviceAttenuator` reported and
  the sample stream left untouched, with no other engine change.
  (`alsa` 0.9.1 is already an indirect dependency via cpal on Linux, so that
  platform's cost is a dependency *line*, not a new build requirement.)
- **A converted anchor is decoded whole before first audio.** Reached only when
  the device offers no mode at the source rate; measured at ~2.6 s on a
  5:24 24/48 FLAC (ADR-0009). Streaming the fallback resampler would fix it and
  is deliberately unbuilt — the case is rare and the machinery is not free.
- **The event channel is single-consumer** (`std::sync::mpsc`); a broadcast
  channel is needed before a second front end or a remote transport.
- **FLAC-in-MP4 is labelled ALAC** — lofty exposes no MP4 codec discriminator,
  so bit depth is the proxy. Wrong name, right fidelity tier, vanishingly rare.
- **AAC has no gapless trim** (symphonia limitation) — documented per format in
  `playback/mod.rs` rather than papered over. (Vorbis, added later, *is*
  exactly trimmed: Ogg granule positions are sample counts.)
- **`config.rs` is a hand-rolled single-key TOML writer** — adopt the `toml`
  crate when configuration grows beyond a couple of keys.

## Interface

- **A serious UX pass with expert guidance** — the current look is deliberate
  but scaffolding-grade (ADR-0006 exists to make replacing it cheap). Vetted
  community design skills to be shortlisted and owner-approved first.
- **Light theme variant** — the palette is dark-first; tokens are in place, the
  light values are not.
- **No readout for the *direct* signal path** — the bottom bar shows the chain
  only when the engine is converting (ADR-0009 §5, deliberately). The listener
  who wants to *confirm* 24/96 is reaching the device untouched has only the
  `[playback] signal path:` stdout line; the proper home for that, with
  `EngineHandle::conversions()` alongside it, is a diagnostics view.
- **Transport buttons take no keyboard focus and publish no accessibility tree**
  — iced 0.13 offers neither (no AccessKit). Tooltips and 32 px hit targets are
  the whole of what the toolkit currently allows.
- **Panel hiding / layout flexibility** — the v0.1 sketch promised a fixed
  layout *with hideable panels*; hiding is unwritten.
- **No keyboard route out of the search field.** Transport keys are bound
  (`crates/baz/src/keys.rs`), but iced 0.13's `text_input` captures every key
  press while focused except Tab and the vertical arrows, so while the search
  well has focus *nothing* is a shortcut — the field takes the key and the
  subscription never sees it. Escape blurs it, which is the whole of the
  escape hatch today. A proper fix wants a focus-aware shell (or a toolkit
  that reports focus synchronously), which is the same missing capability as
  the accessibility gap above.
- **No shortcut discovery in the interface.** The bindings are in the README
  and nowhere the user can see them while running — no `?` overlay, no menu.

## Platform integration

- **No application icon.** `packaging/baz.desktop` therefore carries no
  `Icon=` key (a key naming a file no package installs is worse than none),
  and desktops fall back to a generic launcher icon. Add the key in the same
  change that adds the artwork; `crates/baz/src/icon.rs` is the in-UI transport
  glyph sheet, not an app icon.
- **`OpenUri` is not implemented**, so MPRIS's `SupportedUriSchemes` and
  `SupportedMimeTypes` are empty and the desktop entry registers no
  `MimeType=`. baz plays what it scanned; "open this file with baz" is a real
  feature (queue-a-path, plus a `%U`-aware `Exec=`) rather than a property, and
  advertising schemes we would refuse is the kind of small lie the honesty rule
  rules out.
- **MPRIS `Previous` is a documented no-op** and `CanGoPrevious` is `false`:
  `baz_core::protocol::Command` has no previous-track command. Adding one is an
  engine change, not a front-end one.
- **No MPRIS `TrackList` or `Playlists` interface** (`HasTrackList` is
  `false`), and no `LoopStatus`/`Shuffle` — baz has neither loop nor shuffle
  yet, so they are absent rather than present-and-fixed.
- **`Rate` and `Volume` are read-only `1.0`.** baz has no rate control
  (ADR-0009: it plays at the source rate) and no volume control at all; a
  writable property that discarded writes would be worse than an error.
- **Windows/macOS media-key and now-playing integration** — untouched. The
  `Media*` key names are bound in `keys.rs`, which covers a focused window;
  SMTC (Windows) and `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` (macOS) are not.
